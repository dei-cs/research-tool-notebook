      "Imagine you have a camera app on your smartphone, and it can automatically identify the type of object in an image (e.g., dog, cat, car, etc.). This is made possible by machine learning algorithms.\n",

      "When the algorithm is first trained, it's shown thousands of images with corresponding labels (e.g., \"dog\" for an image of a furry creature). The algorithm then uses this training data to learn patterns and features that are common among those objects. Over time, as you take more photos, the algorithm refines its understanding of what constitutes a \"dog\", \"cat\", or other objects.\n",

      "\t+ A whiskered face as a \"cat\"\n",
